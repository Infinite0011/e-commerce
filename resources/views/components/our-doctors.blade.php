                <p class="mb-4 p-0 font-light" style="text-align:center;">Ahmet Ergin, MD, FACE, CDCE, ECNU is a leading endocrinologist with a
                    particular interest and passion for diabetes care. Dr. Ergin completed his
                    fellowship training from the prestigious Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio. After seeing
                    thousands of patients over the course of his career, he knew he had to branch out and
                    do more and so with seeds of hope and love, SugarMD was created. Dr. Ergin believes in patient
                    education, holistic approach as well as medical intervention when necessary. </p>

                        <p class="mb-4 p-0 font-light">Prediabetes is a stage of diabetes when blood sugar levels are high, but not high enough
                            to be diagnosed as diabetes. Prediabetes is also known as impaired fasting
                            glucose or
                            impaired glucose tolerance. Prediabetes can lead to type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and
                            stroke. The best way to prevent prediabetes from progressing to type 2 diabetes
                            is
                            through lifestyle changes, such as eating a healthy diet and getting regular physical
                            activity. There are also prediabetic dietary supplements that can help
                            prediabetics
                            maintain healthy blood sugar level.</p>
                        <p class="mb-4 p-0 font-light">If you have prediabetes, you might be interested in finding dietary supplements that will
                            assist you in better managing your condition and warding off diabetes.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 p-0 font-light">Besides, diabetics are not the only people who can benefit from prediabetic
                            supplements.</p>
                        <p class="mb-4 p-0 font-light">Prediabetic dietary supplements can also be used to assist individuals in prediabetes in
                            controlling their blood sugar levels and warding off the development of
                            diabetes.
                            People who have prediabetes have a higher risk of developing diabetes than the general
                            population does. As a result, prediabetics have a greater responsibility to
                            monitor their
                            diets and blood sugar levels than the general population does.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 p-0 font-light">Prediabetics can benefit from taking prediabetic supplements because these supplements
                            can supply prediabetics with the nutrients they require to keep their blood sugar
                            levels
                            under control. prediabetic dietary supplements can also be beneficial to prediabetics
                            because they supply them with the essential vitamins and minerals that are
                            required to
                            forestall the development of diabetes. Supplements targeted at prediabetes play an
                            important role in both the prevention and treatment of the condition.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 p-0 font-light">SugarMD Super Berberine is one example of a pre-diabetic supplement that may be useful,
                            despite the fact that there is no universally applicable treatment for
                            prediabetes. This
                            supplement includes dihydro-berberine and cinnamon from Ceylon, both of which have been
                            shown to assist in the regulation of blood sugar levels. Other possible
                            supplements
                            include magnesium, alpha lipoic acid, and thiamine, in addition to a great deal of
                            additional nutrients that are not included in SugarMD Diavitamin. You can lower your
                            chance
                            of acquiring diabetes and help keep your blood sugar levels under control if you take
                            the appropriate steps. Today is the day to schedule your coaching appointment with
                            SugarMD.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 p-0 font-light">Dihydroberberine is a compound found in a variety of plants, including barberry,
                            goldenseal, and Oregon grape. It has a wide range of potential health benefits,
                            including blood
                            sugar control. This makes it a promising supplement for people with prediabetes or type
                            2 diabetes. In a study of people with prediabetes, those who took
                            dihydroberberine
                            supplements had lower blood sugar levels than those who didn't take the supplement. The
                            dihydroberberine group also had improvements in other markers of diabetes, such
                            as
                            hemoglobin A1c. These findings suggest that dihydroberberine may help to improve blood
                            sugar control in people with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes. In addition to blood
                            sugar
                            control, dihydroberberine may also have other benefits for people with diabetes. For
                            example, it has been shown to lower cholesterol levels and blood pressure. It may
                            also help
                            to protect against diabetic neuropathy, which is a common complication of diabetes.</p>
                        <p class="mb-4 p-0 font-light">Dihydroberberine and berberine are two compounds that are often found in diabetic dietary
                            supplements. Both of these compounds have been shown to improve insulin
                            sensitivity
                            and help prediabetic patients to better control their blood sugar levels. However,
                            dihydroberberine has a few advantages over berberine. First,<span>dihydroberberine is 5 times more
                                    efficiently absorbed by the body</span>,meaning that it is more effective at lowering
                            blood sugar levels. Additionally, dihydroberberine has been shown to reduce
                            cholesterol levels
                            and improve cardiovascular health. As a result, dihydroberberine may be a more effective
                            prediabetic supplement than berberine.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 p-0 font-light">Overall, dihydroberberine appears to be a promising supplement for people with diabetes.
                            It may help to improve blood sugar control and protect against complications of
                            the
                            disease.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 p-0 font-light">When it comes to cinnamon, there are two main types: Ceylon and cassia. Both varieties
                            come from the bark of evergreen trees and have similar flavor profiles. However,
                            they
                            differ in their levels of a compound called coumarin. Coumarin is known to have
                            blood-thinning effects and can be dangerous for people with liver problems or those
                            taking
                            blood-thinning medication. As a result, Ceylon cinnamon is often considered the safer
                            option for regular consumption. Cassia cinnamon may still be used in small amounts
                            as a
                            flavoring agent, but it should be avoided if possible by people with liver problems or
                            those taking blood-thinners. In addition, Ceylon cinnamon is often used as a
                            natural
                            prediabetic supplement due to its insulin-sensitizing effects. Therefore, if you are
                            looking for a cinnamon supplement, Ceylon cinnamon is generally the better choice.
                            SugarMD
                            Super Berberine has 20 times concentrated Ceylon Cinnamon equal to 4 gr of total
                            cinnamon which is the required amount for clinically meaningful affect.</p>
